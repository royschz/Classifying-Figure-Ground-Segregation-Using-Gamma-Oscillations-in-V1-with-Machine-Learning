# Classifying Figure-Ground Segregation Using Gamma-Oscillations in V1 with Machine-Learning
This project applies Machine Learning to explore the link between gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) and figure-ground segregation in texture stimuli. Using RF, SVM, and XGBoost on V1 neural data, features like 'ContrastHeterogeneity' predict gamma synchronization in visual processing.
