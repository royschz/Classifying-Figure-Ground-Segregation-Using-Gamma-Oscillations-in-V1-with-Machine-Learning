# Classifying Figure-Ground Segregation Using Gamma-Oscillations in V1 with Machine-Learning
The next project has the aim to apply Machine Learning techniques, in order to investigate the relationships between the gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) and figure-ground segregation in texture stimuli. Using features like Contras Heterogeneity and Grid Coherence, we can explore how the gamma synchronization influences visual processing. 
## Machine Learning Model: 
- Random Forest (RF). 
- Support Vector Machine (SVM). 
- XGBoost.
